Using scp to transfer data
“scp” means “secure copy”, which can copy files between computers on a network. You can use this tool in a Terminal on a Unix/Linux/Mac system.

To upload a file from your laptop to Amazon instance:

$scp -i ~/Desktop/amazon.pem ~/Desktop/MS115.fa  ubuntu@ec2-54-166-128-20.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/data/
This command will upload a file - MS115.fa in your ~/Desktop/ folder of your laptop to folder ~/data/ on an Amazon instance. Note you still need to use the private key you used to connect to the Amazon instance with ssh. (In this example, it is the amazon.pem file in ~/Desktop/.

Note: You need to make sure that the user “ubuntu” has the permission to write in the target directory. In this example, if ~/data/ was created by user “ubuntu”, it should be fine.

Similarly, to download a file from Amazon instance to your laptop:

$scp -i ~/Desktop/amazon.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-166-128-20.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/data/ecoli_ref-5m-trim.fastq.gz ~/Download/
This command will download a file /data/ecoli_ref-5m-trim.fastq.gz from Amazon instance to your ~/Download folder in your laptop.

Note: You can use asterisk(*) to download multiple files, like *.fasta.gz.
